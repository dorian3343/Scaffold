# Scaffold scripts

---
## Build tool (Ruby)

### How to run
To run the build tool, run this command from the project root:
```ruby
    ruby ./scripts/build.rb
```
### What it does
The tool will build two folders, one with a linux build and the other with a window.
They come prepackaged with the hello world Scaffold App. This process can run even 1-2 minutes due it running test's and then building.
